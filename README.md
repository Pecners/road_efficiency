# About

This repo holds the code for a project described in [this blog post](https://spencerschien.info/post/road_directness/) and [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/MrPecners/status/1500255045841006596).

**Fair warning: as of 3/5/2022, I need to go through the code here, clean it up, make sure it runs out of the box.** I'll remove this message when I have it cleaned.
